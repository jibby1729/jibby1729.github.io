# Jibran Iqbal Shah - Academic Portfolio Website

This is an academic portfolio website built with React 19, TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. You will mostly find my projects and what I have done, along with some occasional thoughts I post about my views on some things (academic).
