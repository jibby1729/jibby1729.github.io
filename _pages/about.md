Welcome! My name is Jibran, and this is my personal website. 

As an undergraduate, I completed the Mathematics specialist program at the University of Toronto, alongside a minor in Computer Science. I am now an incoming Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Toronto, starting Fall 2025.

Currently, I am working in the <a href="https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Vision and Learning Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/" target="_blank">Florian Shkurti</a> on uncertainty calibration in perception-based motion planners.
